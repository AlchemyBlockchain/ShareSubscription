# ShareSubscription
Alchemy let's you bundle &amp; share or ReSell your subscription into a smart contract.

# Overlay Account Environment:
The way it works is: Users will experience an "OverlayApp" Environment that Loads their personal Library from their Uni.Key Vault, on top, and masks the original seller's account. Their library appears as a Overlay & buttons like play for exampnle: will encapsulate a "searchAndPlay()" to replicate the experience of it being a Native account!

Depending on the service, The seller's Network & IP address may also be used as a secure proxy (buyer has no access, nor can see identifying information: IPs, Mac address, UUIDs)

And if necessary: an Emulated experience is possible for hard to circumvent DRM apps!

# Hours per Day:
As a Seller you are capped at so many Hours a day/week/month you can Sell your library!
For free sharing you can share it full 24 hours a day. But for profit Selling? Can only share for 40 - 80 hours a week, which is considered a standard if the subscription were to be used for work.

## Compromise: may be necessary
In some cases, and when there is a lot of pushback from the Publisher (we are a DAO and cannot be shut down, We DO NOT respond to legal threats! but do intend to play fair in society & the marketplace) we may lower this cap to a set # of hours we have Compromised on.

# Intention / Goal
This "Re-packaging" & Sharing Subscriptions model is intended to Maximize the amount of brand awarenes and market penetration of Good companies & publishers! By exposing them to a global audience and the entire World's Population, many of whom may not have access otherwise (due to reglatory, trade, & government restrictions)

We can hope for a Freer and more just world, in the realm of Copyrights and consumer rights & accessibility of media!

We indend to provide social Incentives as well as economic models to further this goal.
